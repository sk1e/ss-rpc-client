# ss-rpc-client

SS-RPC (Synchronous S-expression-based Remote Procedure Call) allows
you to extend Emacs functions in non-elisp (currently just
[Racket](https://github.com/sk1e/ss-rpc-server)) languages. It
features better perfomance compared to similiar programs and mutual
remote calls between server and client. 

SS-RPC depends on [log4e](https://github.com/aki2o/log4e) and [tco](https://github.com/Wilfred/tco.el).

For details, please consult source code with docstrings.
